#  JustDice-Analytics-Engineer-Hiring-Case-Application
 This is a case study project I created to showcase my skills and knowledge as an analytics engineer, as part of my application to JustDice, a leading online gaming company. The project involves building an analytics solution for JustDice to help them analyze and optimize their user acquisition and retention strategies.  The solution comprises several components, including data wrangling and analysis scripts, a data warehouse, and a set of interactive dashboards and reports. The data wrangling and analysis scripts clean, transform, and analyze a dataset of user interactions with the JustDice platform, and load the results into the data warehouse. The dashboards and reports provide insights on key performance indicators, such as user engagement and conversion rates, and allow JustDice to track their marketing campaigns and monitor user behavior in real-time.  The project is implemented using various analytics and data engineering tools and technologies, including Python, SQL, and Power BI. It demonstrates my ability to work with complex datasets, design scalable and robust analytics solutions, and communicate insights effectively through data visualization and storytelling.
