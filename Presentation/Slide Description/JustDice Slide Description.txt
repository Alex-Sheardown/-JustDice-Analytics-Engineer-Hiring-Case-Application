Just Dice Slide Description

Slide 1: Opening
Hello and thank you for joining us today. My name is Alex Sheardown and I am here to present the financial performance of our company for the past year.
Our goal for today is to provide you with a comprehensive overview of our financial situation, including our key performance indicators, 
insights we have gained from our data analysis, and potential opportunities for growth.
Before we dive into the details, let's take a moment to set the context and introduce the data we will be working with.

Slide 2: Overview
To begin, our analysis is based on data from CSV files containing information on installs, ads, revenue, and payouts. 
This data has been thoroughly analyzed to provide a comprehensive understanding of our company's financial performance.
We will be discussing the key findings and implications of this analysis in the following slides, 
as well as actionable plans to capitalize on opportunities for growth. So, let's dive in and explore our data insights and business strategy plan for the upcoming year.

Slide 3: General KPIs
As you can see from the data on this slide, we had a total of 216,887 new installations over the past year. 
Our apps were successful in generating a profit of $418,845.25. This number was derived by subtracting app payouts from app revenue. 
While this number is impressive, we did spend $254,075.98 on advertising, which is something we need to take into consideration when evaluating our overall financial performance. 
These key performance indicators give us a starting point to analyze our performance and identify areas where we can improve in the upcoming year.
Slide 4: Summary from App data (Dashboard 1) 
This dashboard attempts to shine light on the profit generated by our apps. As you can see the donut chart on the left shows profit breakdown by app and on the left, 
we can see the breakdown of installations by another donut chart. 
The cards on the bottom of the dashboard provide key information about our performance, including the total payout, revenue, profit, and count of apps.
This dashboard is valuable in helping us understand which apps are performing well and where we should focus our resources to optimize our profitability. 
By analyzing the data in this dashboard, we can identify which apps are generating the most revenue and profit and act to further develop and promote those apps.
This dashboard is just one piece of the puzzle in understanding our overall app performance, but it provides us with valuable insights to help us make data-driven decisions moving forward. 
In the next slide we will discuss key insights as well as implications.  

Slide 5: Breaking Down App Data 
Looking at our app data, we see that there are a total of 51 apps in our portfolio. 
However, what's most interesting is that the top three apps generate a whopping 77% of our total profit, while accounting for 55% of total app downloads.
This means that we need to closely monitor and optimize these top-performing apps to ensure that they continue to perform well. At the same time, 
we can also explore opportunities to promote other high-potential apps in our portfolio, which can help to drive increased revenue and profit for the company.

Slide 6: Potential Next Step Form Dashboard (1)
Now that we've identified the top-performing apps let's look at our actionable plan to drive increased revenue.
First, we can analyze the performance of the other 48 apps to identify reasons for low profitability. 
Which will then determine whether to allocate more resources to improve these apps or phase them out.
To gain a better understanding of user needs and preferences, we can conduct user research. 
This will enable us to develop and test new apps that align with user needs and show potential for profitability.
Through these efforts, we aim to drive increased revenue and further strengthen our position in the market.

Slide 7: Average Profit by App Dashboard (2)
On this dashboard slide, we have two bar charts that show the average profit generated by each app and the number of installations for each app. 
The bar chart on the top shows the average profit generated by each app, while the chart on the bottom shows the number of installations for each app.
Looking at this dashboard, we can see that the top-performing apps in terms of average profit are some of the least installed apps. 
This presents us with an opportunity to promote these apps to drive increased revenue. 

Slide 8: High Profitability of Top 3 Apps Despite Low Download Count
Moving on from the dashboard, we want to highlight some key insights that we've drawn from the data. 
First, we see that the 3 highest on average profit apps have an average profit of 10.47, which is quite high compared to the rest of our apps. 
However, these apps have less than 1% of total app downloads.
So, what does this mean for our business? While these apps may have a small number of installs, 
their high profitability suggests that they could be a lucrative area of focus for further development and marketing efforts. 
By investing more resources into these apps, we may be able to replicate their success in other areas and drive increased revenue.
 
Slide 9: Potential Next Step from Dashboard (2)
Based on the insights we've gathered from our data analysis; we have identified two potential steps for further growth and development:
Firstly, we should consider allocating more resources towards the development and marketing of similar high-profit apps with a smaller user base. 
While these apps may have a smaller number of installs, their high profitability suggests that they could be a lucrative area of focus for our efforts. 
By investing in the development and marketing of such apps, we can tap into a new, profitable market segment and drive growth for our company.
Secondly, we need to investigate the reasons behind the high profitability of the top 3 apps and determine if their success can be replicated in other areas. 
We should analyze the features and characteristics of these apps to identify what makes them so successful and see if we can apply these learnings to other areas of our business. 
This will allow us to replicate the success we've had in these areas and achieve further growth and profitability across our entire app portfolio.
By taking these steps, we believe we can unlock significant opportunities for growth and drive profitability for our business.

Slide 10: App Profit vs Add Spending Comparison (Dashboard 3)
Moving on to our final dashboard, we are presenting a comparison of advertising spending versus revenue based on the countries where our apps are downloaded. 
We have also included a tree map to show the total revenue generated by country and then by app.
The clustered bar chart shows that while some countries have higher ad spending compared to revenue, 
there are others where revenue generated is much higher than ad spending. This suggests that there may be untapped opportunities in those countries where we can focus our ad spending.
The tree map breaks down the revenue generated by country and then by app. 
This provides us with a clearer understanding of which apps are performing well in which countries and can help us make strategic decisions regarding ad spending and future app development.
Overall, this dashboard highlights the importance of analyzing the revenue and ad spending data on a country-by-country basis to optimize our advertising strategy and increase revenue.

Slide 11: Key Insights on App Performance by Country
This slide highlights some key insights and their implications from our last dashboard. 
One country stands out as the leader in generating ad revenue and profit, and two countries have higher return rates than the others. 
We also noticed that the top profit apps vary by country, showing a regional difference in what apps are popular. 
Based on these insights, we can take some actions such as focusing on targeted marketing efforts in the leading market, 
exploring opportunities for growth and expansion in countries with a high return rate, 
and developing and promoting localized apps that cater to the preferences and needs of users in different countries.
 
Slide 12: Potential Next Step from Dashboard (3)
By considering the insights and implications presented in the previous slide, 
we can develop an actionable plan to improve revenue and profitability. To achieve this, 
we recommend conducting a comprehensive analysis of the targeted market to gain a deeper understanding of user behavior, preferences, and trends. 
This will enable us to develop targeted marketing and promotion strategies for the top-performing countries to maximize user engagement and revenue generation.
In addition, investing in localized app development and promotion efforts can expand the user base in different regions and increase profitability. 
By focusing on the unique preferences and needs of users in each country, we can better position our apps to meet their specific demands and improve overall profitability. 
By following these actionable plans, we can ensure that our apps are well-positioned to maximize revenue and profitability.

Slide 13: Summary
Despite the highly competitive app market, our company has demonstrated strong performance, achieving a total profit of $164,769.27 after accounting for ad spending. 
Through our analysis, we have identified several opportunities for growth, 
including expanding our user base in countries with high return rates and promoting localized apps to better serve diverse markets.
By focusing on optimizing our top-performing apps and investing in targeted marketing and promotion strategies, 
we are well-positioned to continue our success and drive future growth. We are excited to leverage our insights and take actionable steps to further strengthen our position in the app market.
